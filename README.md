# surf_codesample

This is a collection of code projects I have worked on recently (within the last year). They come from my coursework, research, and self-study.

1. **bilevel_optimization_IRDSGT**: this is code I have written and actively use for my research assistant position with Dr. Farzad Yousefian. We investigate an Iterated-Regularized Distributed Stochastic Gradient Tracking (IR-DSGT) method for bilevel stochastic optimization problems. There is more information inside the folder detailing each file and its uses.

2. **gradient_subgradient_methods**: this is a short Jupyter Notebook file looking at gradient and subgradient descent and some small experiments to validate theoretical findings of GD and LASSO, using numpy.

3. **intro_pytorch_optim**: an assignment for CS462 Deep Learning at Rutgers University, taught by Dr. CW Cowan. I investigate basic results of gradient descent and regularization using PyTorch.

4. **c_malloc_project**: an assignment for CS214 Systems Programming at Rutgers University, taught by Dr. David Menendez. This project simulates the C standard library's `malloc()` command entirely in the runtime stack.

I also have experience with Java programming, with heavy emphasis on OOP and industry-standard workflow tools. However, I cannot include them here as they are part of the Amazon code base.
