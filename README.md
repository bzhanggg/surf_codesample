# surf_codesample

This is a collection of code projects I have worked on recently (within the last year). They come from my coursework, research, and self-study.

1. **bilevel_optimization_IRDSGT**: this is code I have written and actively use for my research assistant position with Dr. Farzad Yousefian. We investigate an Iterated-Regularized Distributed Stochastic Gradient Tracking (IR-DSGT) method for bilevel stochastic optimization problems. There is more information inside the folder detailing each file and its uses.

2. **gradient_subgradient_methods**: this is a short Jupyter Notebook file
