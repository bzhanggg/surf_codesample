# Bilevel Optimization with Directed/Undirected Graph Library

This is a collection of the code I actively use in my research. We look at numerical validation of a proposed IR-DSGT algorithm on multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, etc) and compare against common regularized DSGT (R-DSGT) algorithms, such as ridge and lasso.

`IR-DSGT_comparison.ipynb` is the Jupyter Notebook where I collect numerical results. The current version included here is not comparing against R-DSGT, but ISR-DSGT (Inexact Sequential Regularization), to see how IR-DSGT competes against a theoretical algorithm that follows a Tikhonov method.

`DSGT_functions.py` is a collection of function definitions (objective functions, loss functions, optimization algorithms) that are used frequently in the Jupyter Notebook.

`DiTree.py` is a small library, built using NetworkX, used to randomly generate directed and undirected networks that satisfy row and/or column stochasticity requirements. Specifically, every graph generated by the DiTree class satisfies the requirements in Assumption 2 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07564v3.pdf).
